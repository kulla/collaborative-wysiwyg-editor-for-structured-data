# A collaborative WYSIWYG editor for structured documents

We want to write a WYSIWYG editor for JSON structures. Unlike modern editor
frameworks like Lexical, ProseMirror, or Slate, it also supports plain objects
with ordered properties (the order of their properties is the order you see in
the editor). You can intuitively update or change any node in the JSON, much
like using functional lenses for direct, targeted edits.
